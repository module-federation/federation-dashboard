# Bi-Directional Hosts Example

# Running Demo

Run `yarn start`. This will build and serve both `app1` and `app2` on ports 3001 and 3002 respectively.

- [Home is on localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001/)
- [DSL is on localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002/)
- [Nav is on localhost:3003](http://localhost:3003/)
- [Search is on localhost:3004](http://localhost:3004/)
- [Utils is on localhost:3005](http://localhost:3005/)

Notice that `app1` will asynchronously load `app2`'s button and vice versa.
